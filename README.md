# WhatsApp Automation Backend (Showcase)

This repository is a **demo / showcase backend project** that demonstrates how a custom WhatsApp automation system can be built using webhooks and REST APIs.

The project is intentionally simplified and does **not** include real credentials, tokens, or production-sensitive data.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- How WhatsApp webhook-based integrations work
- How backend logic can be structured for message handling
- How automation flows can be designed without relying on no-code tools

This is **not a commercial product**, but a technical showcase.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Webhook handling (incoming messages & events)
- REST API endpoints
- Message routing & basic automation logic
- Separation of concerns (controllers / services)
- Secure handling of environment variables (conceptual)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Backend: PHP (custom-built, framework-agnostic)
- APIs: REST
- Integration style: Webhook-based
- Environment: Demo / local development

---

## 📌 Notes

- No real WhatsApp credentials are included
- Logic is simplified for demonstration purposes
- The structure reflects how a real-world system could be designed

---

## 📂 Possible Extensions

- Example webhook payloads
- Message flow diagrams
- Basic rate-limiting or validation logic
